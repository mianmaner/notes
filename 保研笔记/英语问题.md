During the Anti-Japanese War, Nankai University was bombed by Japanese forces, forcing the school to relocate to Kunming, where it formed the National Southwestern Associated University together with Peking University and Tsinghua University. After the war, Nankai University returned to Tianjin and quickly resumed its development. It has now become one of China's top universities.
